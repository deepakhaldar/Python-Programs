Look at the stars above
Find constellations.
They notice you when you notice them
Sometimes, they'd even talk.

Watch the trees that pass by
Look at the birds that fly
The earth rotated hundreds of miles
While across the park you walk

Millions of people around you
Each living a life as complex as your own
To you, they hardly exist
To them, you aren't even here.

Yet, feel the wind hitting your face
Believe in your presence
There's nothing that is too far away
There's nothing that is too near.
